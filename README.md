The **SuluArticleBundle** integrates a performance optimized way for managing articles into the [Sulu](https://sulu.io/) 
content management system. In the context of this bundle, **articles are localized content-rich entities** that are 
**manageable via the Sulu administration interface** and can be **rendered on a website delivered by Sulu**. 
This makes them a good choice for managing things like blog posts, products or even recipes inside of a Sulu project. 
To keep things clean, the bundle allows to **manage different types of articles via separated lists** in the 
administration interface.

The SuluArticleBundle is compatible with Sulu **starting from version 2.0**. Have a look at the `require` section in 
the [composer.json](https://github.com/sulu/SuluArticleBundle/blob/master/composer.json) to find an 
**up-to-date list of the requirements** of the bundle.


## üöÄ&nbsp; Installation and Documentation

Execute the following [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) command to add the bundle to the dependencies of your 
project:

```bash
composer require sulu/article-bundle
```

Afterwards, visit the [bundle documentation](https://github.com/sulu/SuluArticleBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc) to 
find out **how to set up and configure the SuluArticleBundle** to your specific needs.


## üí°&nbsp; Key Concepts

### Article Characteristics

Similar to Sulu pages, articles are **configured via templates** and can include additional **SEO and excerpt information**.
Moreover, articles support the same **drafting, publishing and versioning functionality** as provided by pages.
On the other hand, in contrast to Sulu pages, articles are **managed in a flat list** instead of a tree structure. 
Furthermore, unlike the Sulu page tree, the article bundle is **optimized for managing a big number of articles** without 
any performance decline.


### Elasticsearch dependency

The SuluArticleBundle was originally developed to be used in the publishing industry. To allow for **implementing 
efficient and flexible search endpoints** for a big number of articles, the bundle **utilizes a view layer that is 
stored in an Elasticsearch index**. This makes Elasticsearch a **hard dependency** of the bundle. If your project will 
not utilize these performance optimizations, it might be more convenient to use Sulu pages below a specific parent 
page instead of articles for managing content-rich entities.


## ‚ù§Ô∏è&nbsp; Support and Contributions

The Sulu content management system is a **community-driven open source project** backed by various partner companies. 
We are committed to a fully transparent development process and **highly appreciate any contributions**.
